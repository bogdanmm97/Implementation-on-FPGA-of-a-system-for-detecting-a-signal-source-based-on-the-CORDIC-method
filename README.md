# Implementation-on-FPGA-of-a-system-for-detecting-a-signal-source-based-on-the-CORDIC-method
This project estimates the direction of arrival of a signal using FPGA technology, in real time. The signal is sampled and quantized by means of external ADC modules (Pmod AD1), after which the respective samples are processed. Using the CORDIC algorithm, the value of the arctangent function can be calculated, based on the values of the samples on the x-axis, respectively y-axis. The angle measurement is transmitted serially (Pmod RS232) and displayed on a monitor. Due to errors that may occur during data transmission, a CRC module has been added for error detection. Several modules have also been introduced to make the results easier for the reader to understand.
